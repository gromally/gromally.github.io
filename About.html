		<p>We at GROMALLY are determined to provide the nation a whole new world of opportunities, so we have initiated this project to uplift the the real indian businessmen community known as 'sabjiwalas'or'rehriwalas'who sell their grocery stock by going street to street and various markets and this all takes a lot of hardwork and its pretty much exhaustive, so we have decided to make an online platform where the commonm business can bring his "rehri" digitally before the consumer community and contributing to the whole new and never before everchanging era of digitalisation of the nation</p>
		<p>Unlike other online grocery sellers, we do not have any inventory based model or any other model which only considers the well off shops of the town and still the little businessmen are ignored, they still have to roam in the streets and in various markets and streets for the whole day and too many grocery carts in the market tend to create chaos on the roads and in markets and then the authorities also blame them for all this chaotic process which takes place on daily basis on a very large scale in each and every part of the country wether it is a metropolitan city,a town or a village. So we at Gromally are determined to provide the small businessmen a chance to bring a change in their daily business life by sitting home away from the harsh and scorching sun out there, plus they can do any other work for the day while their grocery stock will be sold online to the nerabout customers and hence they will be able improve their family's financial status and hence bringing out everlasting positive changs in the indian community.</p>
